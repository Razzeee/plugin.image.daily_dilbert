# Daily Dilbert Plugin for Kodi

## Description
This Plugin allows you to access the Dilbert comic strip through the Kodi MediaCenter.
It provides slightly enhanced to the older "Dilbert plugin" which didn't work for me anymore 
on Jarvis and Krypton. The following features are available:
- Today's Dilbert
- Recent Dilberts 
- Random Dilberts
- Browse by date
- Enter the date

## Background
This is a first Python project project for me as well as first time using Git. As a 
non-trained developer, I am not sure I did everything according to the book - though 
it seems to work. Any feedback or tips are welcome.

Thanks,
